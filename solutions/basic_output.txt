1. The print statement outputs the value of each expression following it,
each value being separated by a single space. Expressions may be listed as a
comma separated list. After all expressions have been outputted, a final newline
is emitted.

2. There are three rules:
 - If a print statement end with a comma and no following expression, the final
   newline is suppressed.
 - If such a print statement is followed by another non empty print statement, a
   space is outputted prior to outputting the values of the second print
   statement.
 - If the second print statement is empty, then a newline is printed, without
   the trailing space.

3. Output follows between ---

---
MUCH_madness_is_divinest_sense,
To_a_discerning_eye;
Much_sense_the_starkest_madness.
'T_is_the_majority_In_this,_as_all,_prevails.
Assent,_and_you_are_sane;
Demur,-you're_straightway_dangerous
And_handled_with_a_chain.

6. We can either use double quotes around the string in it's entirety, which
means the single quote won't end the string, as in "The cat's mat".
Alternatively, we can escape the single quote withint th string and use single
quotes around the string, as in 'The cat\'s mat'. Finally we can triple quotes
of either style, e.g. '''The cat's mat''' or """The cat's mat"""
